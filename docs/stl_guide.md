## 1. Introduction

The STL is designed around the philosophy of generic programming, enabling developers to write code that is both reusable and efficient. It separates algorithms from data structures, which means you can apply the same algorithm to different containers.

---

## 2. Containers

Containers are the building blocks of the STL. They store collections of objects and provide various ways to access and modify these objects.

### Sequence Containers

These containers maintain the ordering of elements and provide sequential access.

#### std::vector
- **Description:** Dynamic array with contiguous storage.
- **Key Features:** Fast random access (O(1)), amortized O(1) push_back.
- **Usage:** General-purpose dynamic arrays.
- **Note:** Detailed guide available in `vector.md`.

#### std::deque
- **Description:** Double-ended queue.
- **Key Features:** Efficient insertions/deletions at both ends.
- **Usage:** When you need to add or remove elements at both front and back.
- **Performance:** Random access is O(1) but with a higher constant compared to vector.

#### std::list
- **Description:** Doubly linked list.
- **Key Features:** Fast insertion and deletion anywhere (O(1) given an iterator).
- **Usage:** When frequent insertion/deletion in the middle is required.
- **Trade-Off:** No random access; linear-time element access.

#### std::array
- **Description:** Fixed-size array that wraps a C-style array.
- **Key Features:** Size is known at compile-time; very lightweight.
- **Usage:** When array size is constant and known ahead of time.

#### std::forward_list
- **Description:** Singly linked list.
- **Key Features:** Lower memory overhead compared to std::list.
- **Usage:** When you need a simple, one-way linked list.

### Associative Containers

These containers store elements in a sorted manner and allow fast lookup by keys.

#### std::set and std::multiset
- **Description:** Sorted collections of unique elements (`std::set`) or allowing duplicates (`std::multiset`).
- **Key Features:** Underlying implementation is usually a balanced binary search tree.
- **Complexity:** O(log n) for insertion, deletion, and search.
- **Usage:** When order and uniqueness are required.

#### std::map and std::multimap
- **Description:** Key-value pairs stored in sorted order; `std::map` ensures unique keys, while `std::multimap` allows duplicates.
- **Key Features:** Fast lookup, insertion, and deletion using keys.
- **Complexity:** O(log n) operations.
- **Usage:** When mapping from keys to values with order preserved.

### Unordered Associative Containers

These containers use hashing for storage, which offers average-case constant time operations but no ordering.

#### std::unordered_set and std::unordered_multiset
- **Description:** Hash-based collections for unique elements (`std::unordered_set`) or duplicates (`std::unordered_multiset`).
- **Key Features:** Average-case O(1) complexity for most operations.
- **Usage:** When order is not needed and fast lookup is a priority.

#### std::unordered_map and std::unordered_multimap
- **Description:** Hash-based key-value pairs.
- **Key Features:** Same benefits as unordered_set, but for mappings.
- **Usage:** When performance is critical and ordering is unimportant.

### Container Adaptors

Container adaptors provide a restricted interface over underlying container types.

#### std::stack
- **Description:** LIFO (last-in, first-out) data structure.
- **Underlying Container:** Typically uses `std::deque` by default.
- **Usage:** When you need stack behavior.

#### std::queue and std::priority_queue
- **Description:** FIFO (first-in, first-out) and priority-based queues, respectively.
- **Underlying Container:** `std::queue` commonly uses `std::deque`; `std::priority_queue` uses a heap structure.
- **Usage:** For task scheduling, buffering, or any scenario requiring ordered retrieval.

## 3. Iterators

Iterators provide a generalized way to access container elements without exposing the underlying representation.

### Iterator Categories

- **Input Iterators:** Read elements in one pass.
- **Output Iterators:** Write elements in one pass.
- **Forward Iterators:** Read and write in one or more passes.
- **Bidirectional Iterators:** Can move both forward and backward.
- **Random Access Iterators:** Support arithmetic operations (e.g., pointer arithmetic).

### Iterator Operations and Validity

- **Traversal:** Iterators allow algorithms to traverse containers in a standardized way.
- **Validity:** Certain operations (like insertions or deletions) may invalidate iterators. For instance, reallocation in `std::vector` invalidates all iterators.

---

## 4. Algorithms

The STL provides a rich set of algorithms that operate on ranges defined by iterators. These algorithms are designed to be generic and work with any container that meets the iterator requirements.

### Overview of Algorithms

- **Non-Modifying Algorithms:** e.g., `std::find`, `std::count`, `std::accumulate`.
- **Modifying Algorithms:** e.g., `std::copy`, `std::transform`, `std::fill`.
- **Sorting and Searching:** e.g., `std::sort`, `std::binary_search`, `std::partial_sort`.
- **Set Operations:** e.g., `std::set_union`, `std::set_intersection`.

### Complexity Guarantees

Each algorithm in the STL comes with complexity guarantees. For example, `std::sort` typically offers O(n log n) performance, while `std::binary_search` is O(log n), assuming the range is sorted.

---

## 5. Function Objects and Lambdas

### Function Objects (Functors)

- **Definition:** Objects that can be treated as though they are functions. They are instances of classes that overload the `operator()`.
- **Usage:** Often used in algorithms to customize behavior, such as comparison in `std::sort`.
- **Example:**
  ```cpp
  struct Compare {
      bool operator()(int a, int b) const {
          return a < b;
      }
  };
  // Usage:
  std::vector<int> vec = {3, 1, 4};
  std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end(), Compare());
  ```

### Lambdas

- **Definition:** Anonymous function objects defined inline.
- **Usage:** Provide a concise way to write custom behavior for algorithms without having to define a separate functor.
- **Example:**
  ```cpp
  std::vector<int> vec = {3, 1, 4};
  std::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [](int a, int b) { return a < b; });
  ```

---

## 6. Utilities and Other Components

### Allocators

- **Purpose:**  
  Control the memory allocation strategy for containers.
- **Default Allocator:**  
  The STL uses `std::allocator` by default.
- **Custom Allocators:**  
  You can define your own allocators to optimize performance, control memory fragmentation, or add logging.

### Pair and Tuple

- **std::pair:**  
  A simple container to hold two heterogeneous objects.
- **std::tuple:**  
  An extension of pair that can hold any number of objects.
- **Usage:**  
  Frequently used for returning multiple values from functions or for associative containers (e.g., `std::map` key-value pairs).

### Smart Pointers

- **Types:**  
  `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr`.
- **Purpose:**  
  Manage dynamic memory automatically and safely, avoiding manual `new`/`delete` calls.
- **Usage:**  
  Smart pointers are essential for resource management and ensuring exception safety in modern C++.

## 7. Advanced Topics

### Iterator Invalidation

- **Definition:**  
  Iterator invalidation occurs when operations on a container render existing iterators unusable.
- **Rules:**  
  - In `std::vector`, any reallocation (triggered by `push_back` when capacity is exceeded) invalidates all iterators.
  - Insertion or deletion in `std::list` generally does not invalidate iterators except for the erased element.
- **Implications:**  
  When writing algorithms that rely on iterators, be mindful of operations that modify the container.

### Custom Allocators

- **Benefits:**  
  Custom allocators allow for optimization of memory allocation patterns and can reduce overhead in performance-critical applications.
- **Example Use Cases:**  
  - Allocating from a fixed-size memory pool.
  - Tracking memory usage.
- **Integration:**  
  Specified as a template parameter when defining a container:
  ```cpp
  std::vector<int, MyCustomAllocator<int>> myVector;
  ```

### Parallel Algorithms (C++17 and C++20)

- **Overview:**  
  Modern C++ standards introduce parallel versions of many STL algorithms (e.g., `std::sort`, `std::for_each`) by accepting an execution policy.
- **Execution Policies:**  
  - `std::execution::seq` (sequential)
  - `std::execution::par` (parallel)
  - `std::execution::par_unseq` (parallel and vectorized)
- **Usage Example:**
  ```cpp
  #include <algorithm>
  #include <execution>
  #include <vector>
  
  std::vector<int> vec = /* ... */;
  std::sort(std::execution::par, vec.begin(), vec.end());
  ```
- **Benefits:**  
  Leverage multi-core processors to achieve significant speedups in data processing tasks.
